# odin-library
### What does it do?
Yep, its yet another project under Odin, this one being a simple library app.\
It categorises the books you have under fiction and non-fiction, and has these other cool functions:
- Allows you to see the title, author, pages, synopsis and read status of each book you have,
- Tap on the read button to toggle whether you're still reading it or have already finished it,
- Or press the delete button to return it back to the library.
- Last but not least, don't forget the Add button! It creates a dialog where you can add a new book to your existing ones.

This project tested me on the importance of objects in Javascript. They're needed to create the prototype required for every book I add, and I had to manipulate those alongside the DOM when I wanted to return a book. That was tough.\

The rest? Easy.

### Future Updates
Hm. Seems like Odin wants me to return back to this project at a later date. We'll see what happens.

[Nov 2024] UPDATE: Yep, returned to add some extra fancy form validation using the JS Constraint Validation API. I left the basic validation there though, but its nullified by the novalidate bit. Just thought I would keep it there for fun.
